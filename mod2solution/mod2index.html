	<h2>HTML</h2>
	<p>
		It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>H: A text that contains link to other texts.Sometimes they link back to the original doc.<br>M: It is all about content(the data will be published using tags)<br>L: This is implies that there's some syntax(basically there's a write or wrong way to code.)<br>Basically, HTML provides the structure or what component do the docs have.

	<p>
		It stands for Cascading Style sheets.This technology provides styling capability to HTML structure in drastically different ways.It works by associating rules to HTML elements.It is basically concerned with colors,layouts, font-size,any stylistics type of thing.

	<h2>Bootstrap</h2>
	<p>
		It is the most popular framework on github for HTML, CSS & JS.It is a 12 column layout and is used for developing responsive mobile first projects on the web.It is too big and has lots of features but we can use selective download.<br>However,in this first page design we're using media query properties rather than bootstrap!
